#text = input("Whats the text?")
text = '''Okay. Content Cop from Temu,
back at it again.

So just before I get into my interrogation with
former Mr. Beast employee, Jake Weddle,

a lot has happened since my last video.

After posting it, I got hundreds of messages
from former Mr. Best employees,

and I had them all like send
proof of former employment.

Y'know, just people showing their
support or telling their stories of

fake videos or unsafe practices,

toxic workplace, stuff like that.

I'm not really gonna get into those
claims because, for one,

most people wanna stay anonymous,
which I understand.

And also, I think most of that
stuff's just been covered with

the news coming out about
Beast Games and everything.

I also have like more serious allegations
that I want to start covering.

Also, I heard from a very credible source that

Mr. Beast has been sitting on
a response to Part 1

because he was worried if he posted it
I would instantly respond with Part 2

like this is Kidz Bop
Kendrick Lamar vs. Drake.

Also, I know that Mr. Beast's
secret CEO has been practically like

harrassing my people on, y'know,

"Hey, What's in Part 2?
What- What does he know?"

So I will just tell you, James,
what will be in Part 3

so you don't have to harrass my people.

It will be about serious allegations of
sexual misconduct in the company,

and your direct involvement in
covering up those crimes.

And I'll make sure to
give you full credit and

plaster your face all over the
screen when we talk about that.

So yeah, I've gotten dozens of messages
from former Mr. Beast employees of

very serious allegations, so

I just wanna put a call to action
in the start of this video that

if you have a story, you can DM me.
Just make sure you send proof of employment first,

'cause I get a lot of DMs.

And like, as much as I
meme and joke around,

I take anonymity very seriously,

so without explicit permission
I don't go public with anything.

Obviously, if it goes to court, I don't-

I would hope they would censor your
information from the court documents, I dunno.

Oh, and former contestants, too.

That's another thing I heard after
posting my last video.

During the 100 Boys vs. Girls video,

I have people corroborating the same story that

the camera guy who gave the girls a drone
was making some girls feel uncomfortable.

You trap these girls in a circle
and make them sleep on rough turf,

and get them high on paint fumes,
and then you try to fuck them.

- Okay, that- (laughs)
- (laughs)

That seems really dark-

No no, it's not dark, you're just
misunderstanding me, bro.

- I think I am.
- Yeah, you are.

Because if the girl said no,
then the answer obviously is no.

But the thing is, is that
she's not gonna say no.

She would never say no
because of the implication.

Anyway, that will be Part 3, so y'know,

Mr. Beast, do with that
information what you will.

I know Chucky didn't wanna respond
to those allegations.

So anyway, my interview with Jake Weddle.

I chose to interview him because-
I thought he was perfect because

he was both on camera and behind
the scenes in 2019 and 2020

And also, what people don't know
is that he came back in 2021

to be the sole contestant
of a Mr. Beast video

which never got uploaded
because it went very badly.

He also knows about another

"portable document format"

who's working at Mr. Beast while
actually on the registry.

I'll get more into that story
at the end of the video.

So I got his DM, drove straight
to New York overnight, did not sleep.

Just drank a bunch of caffeine and

I also only had one microphone
in the interview, which he's wearing.

So it's mostly just him talking.

Also like, final thing.

People said my last video started slow.

This video also starts slow.
It, y'know, it builds up over time.

But, I'll do the retention thing and say

THE ENDING WILL BLOW YOUR MIND!!!

(EXPLOSION)

IT'S CRAZY!!!

AAAAAAH!!!

Okay. Jake Weddle, everybody.

I'm Jake Weddle. Most people who-

If you know me from
Mr. Beast, I'm a deep cut.

I'm in a few of the videos.

Sometimes, maybe purposefully
kept in the shadows a little bit.

I'm in the cutting room floor a lot of the time.

But I've been in some videos,
I've worked on a lot of them.

I was there from 2019 to 2020.

2021-ish when I came
back and did some more.

I was there when they were authentic,

and then I saw the transition
to what I feel like is a

company, he's like a TV show now.

He went from YouTuber guy
with a camera to Amazon.

The culture around there
was very unspoken, but

there was a vibe.
There was half the people who,

if you made Jimmy happy,
you were on the good half.

And these people got random bonuses,

were usually moved up,
had more screentime.

And then there was people who,
if you had a disagreement

or butt heads with Jimmy, or
just he didn't like you,

y'know, you were the other half. And,

I consistently was in the
half that Jimmy didn't-

Jimmy doesn't like me. That's fine,
I don't like him either. It's okay.

Oh that feels so good to say.
I don't like Jimmy.

I hate you so much.

He didn't want anyone to get
more popular or have more of a,

a way out, necessarily, like
"Oh, I'm doing my Twitch thing on the side."

"Don't do that, 'cause you
could get famous and leave

and talk about me negatively."

And I could tell that the yes-men
were, y'know, doing well.

And I was, y'know,
disgruntled for quite some time.

So I've talked to reporters, right?
Like, publicly, and

I've always had to choose my words
very very carefully because

I don't wanna say anything I
don't stand behind, obviously.

So I used to talk to people- I used to

glaze Jimmy publicly for things
I do genuinely think are true.

But then it's like "Well how come you
didn't talk a bout the working conditions?"

Well, I wanted a career.

I didn't want to, y'know, speak ill
of YouTube's golden boy

and then I'm blacklisted forever.

I've told people I was talking to you,
and they go "Don't! What're you doing!"

"You're gonna kill your career!"
and it's like "I have to, or I'll be sad."

This is the moment, we're gonna
talk about it. So, as far as that,

that's my covering of the "why
we didn't talk about x,y,z sooner"

but now you know.

What would you say is the fakest video
that you worked on while you were there?

Fakest video that I worked
on while I was there.

This is the extent of the
fakeness that I was involved to.

This is like admitting to my complacency.

I was a writer there, and
we were working on a video,

"Crushing My Friends Car with a
Rock" or "Meteor" or something,

It was "rock" or "meteor" in the
title of it, I can't remember, but

He wanted to do a prank where,
unbenounced to the person,

he takes a rock, crushes their car,

and they're supposed to think
think the rock came out of space.

We're gonna take a meteor, and
we're gonna put it on Weddle's car.

We're gonna take another meteor,
and put it on Marcus's car.

Both of them have no idea
that we're doing this.

Weddle and Marcus are probably
shocked. They had no idea.

And so, that was the one
and only time I had to

"Huh? My car? What?"

And on the fly, I saw him,
'cause Marcus was in that video,

so Marcus is calling his mom-
Marcus genuinely had no idea.

He genuinely had no idea.

So Marcus is calling his mom
and his mom's freaking out,

and I'm like "Oh no, they're
gonna call my mom next!"

So I had to text my mom, who had
to beg to get the title very quickly,

now I'm texting my mom, I go

"Mom I'm about to call you
about the meteor thing.

You have no idea, be surprised."

And then I hit send, and then
they go "Call your mom now!"

And I call my mom and I tell her,
and oh she should've got the Oscar!

Oh my- on the fly she goes

"WHAT?! I'M ON VACATION!"

Mom my car has been, um, destroyed.

- (laughs)
- A meteor hit it.

But yeah, I did that video, and they
were supposed to give me $10K

to put a down payment on a new car,

and they wanted me to get
like a big, flashy new car.

$10K was supposed to be a down payment.

I can't afford a big, flashy new car,
'cause I work at Mr. Beast.

So, I couldn't get anything I
could afford the taxes on

I couldn't get anything I
could afford the insurance on.

So I do my part of the video,
and I get a mom van that I can afford.

Jimmy was like "Why didn't
you get a cooler car?"

I was like "I- What do you-
I can't afford that, bro."

"Come on, what're you talking about."

If I was working on a TV show in the 90s

on a show that was a quarter as
successful, I could retire today.

But now, I make dogshit pay
making gajillionaires more money.

And I just walked into the writers room,

And that's one of the
reasons why I left.

Was because I just walked
in there and asked for,

not necessarily a gajillion dollars,

but maybe a salary that was more
proportional to the work I was doing,

given how much revenue
that work was doing.

And then, y'know, I talked about that.

And I talked about the Writer's Guild, and how

this is what the Writer's Guild
industry standard is for 

streaming internet content with ads,

I thought that was the
closest thing to YouTube.

 I didn't even bring up residuals,

'cause oh my god. If I got
residuals for every video I worked on,

boy howdy I could retire. But, yeah.

The other thing I talked about was
there was another writer there.

Older comic, black guy, he had a kid.

I got paid more than him,
and I thought that was wild

because he was older
than me, had a child,

we're doing the exact same job,

and well I'm some 20-year-old
fucking white guy.

Why am I getting paid more
than him? I brought that up.

One of the things I didn't like about

the way some of the
Beast stuff shook out was

I feel really guilty with
the way this like shook out.

Yeah, I was talking to this other writer. Like,
it's fucked up, y'know, that's some pay isn't-

I want you to get paid more, 'cause
you deserve to get paid more.

I don't have a fucking kid.

And he didn't wanna rock the boat.
He desperately didn't wanna rock the boat.

He was just "I like my job, I like coming here"

'Cause when you grow up with, y'know,
nothing, not to say that he did,

but I know I did, y'know.

You get a little something,
you don't wanna lose it.

So he didn't wanna rock the boat.

But he said "Hey man, if that's how
you feel, y'know, if that's- I trust you."

He stood with me. He went in that writer's
room- he went to that meeting with me.

I said my piece, and he backed me up.

I said "I need x,y,z or I'm outta here."

And then they said "Bet," and they
gave me a severance check the next day.

And they gave him a severance check
the next day. And if I knew

If I knew he was gonna lose his
job too, I wouldn't have done it.

Me, I was over the moon.

I was like "You're gonna give me
a check and I get to leave?"

Y'know, I don't get to kneel with the

""How Many Orbeez Can I Fit Up
My Asshole" everyday, y'know.

I get to go home, and you're
gonna pay me to leave.

I was over the moon.

And he was devastated.

He did not want a severence-
he just wanted to be in the room, y'know?

And I really regret that.

But, me and him are really still tight.
We're still good friends.

- Is he doing good?
- Yeah, he's doing good.

He's a good guy, I love that guy.
He's doing good.

And uh- yeah.

So maybe it was for the better?

Honestly, best thing they
could've done for him.

Now that he's very very far removed
from all this crazy shit, I guess.

Do you think Jimmy really enjoys
doing good and helping people?

I think Jimmy wants to be
the best YouTuber.

I think he is laser-focused on one goal,

and I think, whatever he has to do
to achieve that goal, he'll do.

And I think it was the smartest
decision for him that he calculated,

because he's very good with numbers,

"If I donate to charity,
people can't say I'm shitty."

"If I donate to-

"If I give this homeless guy $10K,
what do you mean I'm a bad guy?"

But I've always thought,

if you're gonna do something
nice for somebody

and you stick a camera in
their face while you do it,

you didn't do a nice thing for somebody.
You gained something. You-

There was a homeless guy on the
street, and you saw an opportunity

for yourself and your image, and you

gave one guy $10,000
who needed it to eat,

and now the revenue you
generated from that video

is way more than what you gave.

I think when he's generous on camera,
it's the least authentic thing in the world.

There's an element of, y'know,

"Oh hey, you're crying! That's
so good for camera!"

"I'm so glad he's-

If you're crying because you're so
thankful that you got x,y,z,

and then you go "Oh I'm so glad he
needed it that bad so I could come in and-"

"Can you cry more? Oh it's
so good for the camera if you could-"

Oh, I just- it made me uncomfortable
when I was working there.

And, I didn't like it.

And I vocalized it sometimes,

And I think that's why I wasn't on camera
as much as they said I was gonna be.

I was told at one point that I was
gonna be like fourth banana.

It was gonna be Jimmy,
Kris, Chandler, me.

And then that never happened,
and I remember talking about that like

"Hey, I thought my contract said x,y.z."

And then I got the severance check,
so, y'know, whatever, all of that regard.

So, after your severance checks,
how was your relationship with the company?

I know you appeared in
videos after that, right?

Right. So in videos where
I was appearing in later,

that's why you keep nice publicly.

If you're nice in public,

"Hey, Jake was nice in public.
Let's have him back for something."

"Yeah, sure."
So I was hoping they call back.

And, I appeared in something,
it was after I left.

I think one of them was

"Three Days in a Maximum Security Prison".

If I did do mini challenges
in that, I got paid.

I was clocked in with the rates, and
I would get paid and compensated for those.

But, there was one video I was in
I got paid a lot for, but it didn't-

it didn't come out.

It didn't come out 'cause it didn't go well.

There was a video that came out

probably like a year ago
or something like that.

It was the- it got into a lot of
hot water when it came out.

It was the "Surviving-"

"$10,000 For Every Day You
Survive in Solitary" or

"Surviving Solitary For whatever".

It was like one of those
solitary confinement videos

that got a lot of media attention because
everybody saw the premise and thought

"What?! You shouldn't do that!"

And, people don't know
that was the second attempt.

The first attempt was on me.

And it didn't go well.

I was already planning on
moving to New York,

and I'd worked at a couple of
YouTube companies after Beast.

And I had a little bit
of change in my pocket.

The most change I had in my pocket ever.

Small potatoes compared
to Beast bullshit, but

I thought I had enough to
move to New York or whatever.

And I get a call from
somebody over there

and they go "Hey, they
want you for a video."

I was like "Amazing, great,
cool, thank god!"

"What's the video?"
And they tell me the pitch.

They try to make the pitch sound
like it's gonna be a walk in the park.

The pitch is "A hundred days
in solitary confinement,

but don't worry. You only have to last
like thirty, and we have a video."

They were pitching it like "At first
it's gonna be like a luxury vacation.

You're gonna have like a hot tub
and your ice cream machine,

and part of the video is gonna be
you deciding like 'hm,

what items am I gonna get
rid of today?'" It's like, the choice.

They were like "It's only gonna be bad
for maybe the last like five days, tops,

when you have like nothing left. You're the
first- It's gonna be like a breeze for most of it.

And by the end of it, after thirty days,

you're gonna get $300,000
'cause it's $10,000 a day."

And I dunno, man.

I grew up poor in North Carolina.
I said "(motorboating) Excuse me?"

"I'll dance for ya if you put
that kinda money in my face, sure."

They were like "You're gonna
be locked in this room,

and we gotta make sure
you're on all the time.

we're gonna have cameras
on you all the time,

and you're perfect for this,
'cause you never shut the fuck up."

On paper, I was like "Okay,
I can do this." And I was-

They always cut me out of
the videos. They always-

Editors have told me "It's because
you have too much of a personality."

And so with this video,
I thought "This is perfect."

"It's a video they can't
cut me out of. I'm the guy."

And so, I thought "Well,
if I have to do this-"

"If I have to do solitary confinement
in order to do the things I want to do,

then I will do that."

I held my tongue and I swallowed my pride,
and I tried to do one- one last ride!

I get there, and at first it's fine.

They had just freshly painted
the set. You could smell it, y'know?

Which, that's probably not good.

The smell of fresh paint in your
surroundings for the next x,y,z time.

It looked good on the visual.
It looks good on camera, y'know.

It's movie magic bullshit.

It was a terrible facility. I mean,
it was in one of the studios.

They had to get a separate
tank for, y'know, septic stuff,

Yeah, there was a hot tub in it.
Yeah, there was an ice cream machine.

Like, things were cool
and funny on paper.

But when you think about stuff,

a hot tub that's not connected
to a filtration system.

Give it three days. It's gonna stink, y'know?

There's not a hot water mechanism.
So the hot tub was a lukewarm tub at best,

which, oh that's a silly complaint, but

the shower was always cold,
and you're taking like a quick shower.

I had cameras 24/7 on me.

And the ice cream machine.
Let's talk about that for a second.

That ice cream machine has two modes.

On: (insufferable buzzing)

And Off: reeking of
smelly dairy, mildew.

So I got to choose which
sense was assaulted at a time.

I couldn't have all of them good.

The little things started to
build up. There was like a-

The bug thing wasn't terrible,
but it was a factor and

Like at first, it was fine
y'know. And you're,

you're playing it up like
'cause you know it's a video.

And, it got to a point where

they weren't turning the
lights off. I asked them-

I said "Could we have like
nighttime hours, y'know?"

And they said no, because it would
fuck up the time lapse shots.

The time lapse of what?
Me sleeping? Or me not sleeping?

Yeah, I saw in other videos they did

Like "Oh you're gonna
get x,y,z hours of sunlight."

Oh great! Wanna know
how they figured that one out?

I didn't have it!

Y'know, one of the things was
they got to take away your clocks.

You didn't know what time it was.

Okay, I got no access to sun.
I got no access to clock.

I dunno, like-

The lights are on me all the time.

I wasn't sleeping. I could not sleep.
I have insomnia problems now,

but they might've started there.

I had good people looking out for me.

I had a lot of good people looking out
for me saying "This- we gotta stop."

So, y'know, I just wanted
to turn the lights off.

And I'm vocalizing to people
"I wish the lights would turn off."

And I go up to my friend, my good friend.

And I go "They're not
turning the lights off."

He goes "What?! That's a war crime!"

"We're not allowed to do that to terrorists!"

"Oh! Oh good!"

24 hours breaking the Geneva Convention
I guess is what we're doing.

So, y'know, they're giving me melatonin.

It's not helping, y'know.

And then Jimmy would come in
every other day for like an hour

to check in on me 'cause
he's doing other stuff.

I'm just the guy in the cage over here,
he'll come back to me in a minute.

And so he'd come by,
he'd get the shots, he'd leave.

Sometimes he would have notes
from the director over the phone

that would really piss me off.

This was a note I got from
the director from Jimmy

when I'm receiving some cash.

He said- Jimmy said 
"Can you say to the camera

how thankful you are that now
you can pay back your student loans?"

You know how hard it was
to do a take of that

and pretend to make it genuine?

I didn't wanna have student loans.
I didn't wanna be in a cage.

But Jimmy's the guy with the money, and
if you do what he says, he'll do what you want.

"Oh, you want your student loans
paid off? Be in this cage."

And you have power over people
when one person doesn't have

resources and the other one does.
They hold it over your head and you go

"Of course, of course."
Yeah, I agreed to it.

I needed it, of course.

There's just something about like
having the cameras on me all the time.

Like I was- I was not
having a good time,

but we were filming a video.
So I was trying my best to be funny.

I'm a dark comic, y'know. I got bits about-
I've had a very traumatic life.

My dad is in jail for
sexual assault of a minor,

so this kind of stuff is very
near and dear to my heart.

I don't fuck around with this shit.

I have jokes about that in my act, y'know?

I joke about it because that's what
you do with a traumatic experience.

Abusive relationships. I get out of it,

and the first thing I do is
I do a tight five about it.

So I'm in this situation where
my mental health is not good,

my physical health is getting worse,
but we're filming.

So I'm doing bits!
I'm talking to the camera!

And I'm being, y'know- "Hey it's been
a couple days, I'm not doing so hot!"

Which, if I'm filming a video, that's what
I should be doing for the camera, but

it was too real.

If they're faking videos,
why couldn't we fake this one?

Y'know? If we're allowed to let these
cast members have some time off

of this difficult challenge, how come
we couldn't turn the lights off?

How come we couldn't maybe not have
some time lapse footage for ten seconds?

Did you try to get out?

Yes!

I was starting to calculate,
"Oh, I dunno if I could do thirty."

"How much can I- How can I
manage to get out of here sooner

and still have a video
and still have some cash, and

get the plug, man?"
I just, I did-

Since we're doing time lapse shots,
and since they insisted on time lapse shots,

I said "Alright, we're gonna
do time lapse shots? Bet."

I put my-

I put my YouTube on with
the white board they gave me.

And I was like "Alright, yeah.
Go ahead and scrub that footage."

"You got that white board- oh, no-"

"Either that goes in, or
this footage is unusable."

And then, James Warren
came in and erased it.

Fucking, don't put that in there. Don't-

"Hey, we can torture him.
Don't you dare let him get a plug in there!"

Ah, so...

Like, we were playing up the joke.

It's like "I'm the boy in the cage,"
 y'know, whatever.

I'll play into a joke,
whatever. It's fine.

There's just something weird
about when Jimmy jokes.

I have jokes about my dad
because I love jokes about my dad.

I joke about my dad all the time.
That guy's a piece of shit. I hate my dad.

I have friends that make
fun of my dad. That's fine,

'cause I know their intent,
I know where they're coming from.

When Jimmy joked about my dad,

something about it
seemed weird. I didn't like it.

We were doing one of those
hide-and-seek videos.

Again, at the time,
they were a lot realler.

So I got caught. And when
you get caught, you go to the

place when you get caught.

I dunno if there's footage of this,
I definitely didn't make the final cut,

but he says to me

"Alright, you're going to
jail, y'know. Like your dad."

And like, it's a joke,

but when my friends do it, it's fine.
And Jimmy just wasn't my friend.

He was my boss. And that wasn't cool.

And so now, I'm locked in a cage at his whim,

and I have to do things to get
the cash I need to live.

And I got these cameras on me all the time,

and I was unwell.

I had editors coming up
to me saying "You good, bud?"

And I was like "Yeah, why?"

Y'know, clearly unwell.

And he goes "Well 'cause the footage
you're sending in is haunting."

'Cause I'm trying to be funny, but I am
mentally decaying. So I'm doing bits.

Someone said there is a
horror cut of a video in this.

And I'm sitting there like
"Who's watching this? Like, who-"

"Who wants to see this? What is
fun about this- the video?"

And so I- The thing that made me
wanna- "I gotta get out."

"I can't do another day in here."

Jimmy comes in, and

I'm asleep, I dunno what time it is.
It's like 2 or 3 or whatever, and he's like

"Why's he sleeping?"
I dunno, 'cause I can't sleep.

He comes in, he wakes me up,

and he goes "Ask me why
I have two briefcases."

and I'm like "Why do you have two briefcases?"

and he goes "Oh, 'cause this one's
for today, and this one's for the challenge."

And I go "What's the challenge today?"

He goes "You're gonna run a marathon."

"You're gonna do 22.6K-"
whatever it is-

"and you're gonna do it
on that treadmill over there."

The first challege I did was a Rubik's cube, and

I'm dyslexic, I'm dumb. I dunno
how to do a Rubik's cube.

"So your first challenge: Rubik's cube"
I was like "Oh, I don't wanna do that."

On camera, "I don't wanna do that."

He goes "Just do it for thing.
Like, could you- yeah?"

There was an element of "Oh, Jake will
do what we want 'cause he's in-house."

That's one of the reasons why they got me.
"Jake's- He's an inside guy, so he'll do whatever."

"We can push him a little extra hard
'cause we know he's good. We know he's good."

I couldn't say no to the treadmill thing.

Yeah, so I-

People who run marathons
train forever, and it's still hard.

Again, writer.

Do I look like I can run? I don't run.

Let alone a marathon.
Let alone not training for it.

So, I was in a sunlightless, y'know...

Did you try to say no?
Like did you have a choice, or-?

Based on the Rubik's cube thing, and
based on all the other stuff, they gotta-

There was so much pressure to
just do it, just do the thing y'know.

And I- If I refuse it's just "Well, that's
the whole video. I guess the budget's-"

"So much money up in flames, because
Jake said he wouldn't wanna do the thing."

And so I wanted to be a
good sport, and I wanted to

get the boost, and I wanted the cash.
And so I start running at 12.

I was able to take some breaks.

I asked him "How long do I have?"
He goes "Until I get back."

And I'm running until 3 AM.

I got off the treadmill...

Oh, the blisters I had on my feet
 were like- You wouldn't believe.

Just all over. Just these big, red...

I couldn't walk, my muscles were
like just- the lactic acid, I-

I got off the treadmill, and then the people
who had came in to ice my feet,

make sure I was good.

And that's when I was like
"I'm done. I can't. I'm done. I'm done."

"I'm out. I'm out.
I'm out. I'm out. I'm out."

And that's when psych-

And talked to the psych about
how I'm "Not well!"

Like I said, there was a lot of good people
over there that were saying "You gotta pull him out." 

I had friends that did some freelance work,
and they were telling me- they'd be like

"Yeah everybody knows you over there,
everybody loves you. They go

'Oh Jake Weddle, love that guy.
Shame what happened to him.'"

Like I'm a ghost.

And I asked him, I said "How much longer
are you guys gonna keep me in here?"

And the guy goes "Realistically,
like, at least seven more days?"

"I- no. I'm out."

And they didn't let me leave right away, either.
They wanted to make sure everything was fine.

So I just, y'know, slept for a while.

They turned the lights off.

And, they brought- It's like they
brought in all my friends to make it

They brought in all the people I liked,

and Jimmy.

And everybody was around me, making sure
I was good, making sure I was okay.

But Jimmy had his, like...

He was sitting in the chair, turned around
like an evil villain. Swear to god.

Everyone was looking at me, and
he was like Lex Luthor over there.

He turns around, he stands up,

and he does the exact same thing when he's
pretending to have a human connection.

You know when you're
watching a video, and he's-

he's like "Aw stop,
you're gonna make me cry."

And he like touches his eye
or whatever, as if he's crying.

He's not cr- He's just...

I didn't have to pretend to do that shit.

He says, y'know,

as if rehearsed by his lawyers,

"Yeah, y'know. Your mental health's the most
important thing. Just wanna make sure you're okay."

"The last thing we'd want you to do is s-"

I can almost hear the word "sue"
come out of his mouth.

The "s". He just stopped
right before it got out.

I did not get the $300K.
What I got...

He goes "Think of it this way.
At least you get to keep what you earned."

"You were in there for x,y,z days,
you did x,y,z challenges, so you got y'know

$100,000 and some change, give or take."

You know how much money
I spent in taxes in 2021?

I spent $44,000 in taxes alone.

And now, I spent all that money
doing stand-up. I just-

I bought plane tickets to
go do comedy festivals, y'know.

My family back home, I gave them
a bunch of stuff that they needed.

And I haven't been back on a Beast set

in any official capacity or
unofficial capacity since then.

And then they did the video with somebody
else, and they worked out the kinks.

And then it still got in some
hot water, and I knew it would.

And I've wanted to say a lot of this
for a long, long, long time, and

I feel good now.

I just had to get that out there.

So I just wanna hop in here and show some
texts that Jake sent me after his interview.

This is July 29, 2021, a few days
after he got out of solitary.

(reading texts)

Mind you, this is not supposed to
be a traumatic life event.

This is supposed to be a Mr. Beast video.

(reading texts)

(reading Jake's texts)

(reading texts)

Also, as far as like "He could've
said no, he could've left at any time."

I wanna show this segment from
an internal document at Mr. Beast called

"How to Succeed in Mr. Beast Production".

Specifically on page 19,
there's a paragraph called

"No Does Not Mean No".

Already insane, because it's sort of-

It seems to be co-opting
the popular anti-rape slogan,

which is a terrible look given the allegations
that are gonna be coming out very soon.

It reads:

(reads text)

So yeah, this idea of "pushing through no's" is a
big component to working at Mr. Beast.

And the way that it manifests
itself a lot of the times is like

a director might tell a producer

"Hey, we need access to
30 acres of farmland by Tuesday

or we lose half a million dollars."

Now, if you're the producer,
you obviously know that means

"Get it done or you lose your job."

So what can happen is like
a producer's calling up farmers,

saying "Hey, I need to use your land."

and the farmer might be like "Okay, but..."

"I have animals, you can't be making
really loud noises. No pyrotechnics,

and you gotta clean everything up."

So the producer's sort of
incentivized to lie and say-

or maybe the producer doesn't even actually
know the total contents of the video, right?

Things change last second, so

they're very like- they're financially
incentivized to be manipulative and sort of-

they're put in positions where it's like

"Oh, it's either the producer's job
or a civilian's job."

Like where it talks about "Hey, maybe the
manager would be willing to bend the rules."

Well, you shouldn't really be
pressuring civilians to bend the rules

that could get them fired, y'know?

I'll show you a real life example.
This is unused evidence from Part 1.

I'd seen this Reddit post titled

"Mr. Beast leaving trash behind
and debris at film site in Ayden NC."

(reads second paragraph)

So I actually know that this is from a Mr. Beast
video called "Protect the Yacht Keep It"

where at the end of that
video, he actually says

But if you're wondering, yes we did ensure
the lake was completely cleaned up after this video.

For the love of god, subscribe
so we could pass T-Series.

Yeah, so he says at the end of the video
that they made sure it was cleaned up.

I was actually on site for part of
this production. I was at this camp.

So I decided to send an
email out to the camp

basically saying "Hey,
I heard these rumors."

"I'm investigating similar incidents."

And the camp responded actually not
denying the claims, going on to say

"I am sure that there are
no perfect film productions,

just as there are no perfect people.

I am grateful for the opportunity that
we had to host the production crew,

and because grace [or forgiveness]
has been offered to me so freely,

I will choose to offer the same."

So clearly alluding to the fact
that there was wrongdoing

by Mr. Beast's production team.

And that's like sort of the thing is-

if you're around Greenville, you know
these stories of people working with Mr. Beast

and it being extremely unprofessional,
them not doing what they say.

But they sort of get by a lot
on their good public image, and like-

I mean, this camp offered to
host them completely for free

and I guarantee if you went to the lake
at the camp and you went magent fishing

you'd find all sorts of debris
that's still there to this day, like

they didn't clean it all up.

So in the case of Jake Weddle,
I'm sure that there were producers

who were in a position of
"Hey, if Jake gets out early,

we don't have a video,
and your job is at risk."

So there's a tremendous amount
of pressure, on top of like,

him being delirious from not sleeping and
everything to just manipulate him into staying.

Which, y'know, I'm sure this isn't technically
against the Geneva Convention on torture

because he wasn't technically a prisoner.

He could have left at any time, but
because of the extreme pressure to stay in,

it's not really a reasonable expectation
that he could've just walked out.

...because of the implication.

I think Jimmy is a awkward kid who

maybe had it a little rough
growing up, I can't speak on that,

but I do have empathy for it.

'Cause I, y'know, had it rough growing up and

I think when you're hyperfixated on something

like, I love stand-up, he loves YouTube.
Everyone fixates on a thing, y'know.

I think he just wanted to be
the best YouTuber so bad,

and because the industry's metrics
rewarded some not great behavior,

if you're just going on autopilot
based on what the numbers say,

you can do some things that maybe
aren't good, but reap reward.

And I think Jimmy just did
what the industry,

and maybe what this system
that we have set up demanded, and

he didn't care who got hurt.

And I think Jimmy's surrounded himself with
really, really, not so great people,

and those people were the
ones making the decisions.

And I want to say, really important:

There are so many good people
that worked at Mr. Beast who

are damn good at their jobs, like...

When Jimmy comes in and
asks for something impossible,

it's these people's jobs to do it.

And they- they shouldn't be able to
make it happen, and they do.

And so, I don't think people
wanted to talk about stuff because

I didn't want my friends to lose their jobs.

I don't care about my fucking job.
I'll die in a hole. I don't care.

But I don't want my friends
to lose their jobs, y'know?

I don't want anyone's
reputation to be fucked, y'know?

But- Let's just go back to
my dad for a second, if I may.

My dad was a swim coach,
neighborhood swim team.

Everybody loved him.
Everybody loved him.

Behind closed doors,
he's a real piece of shit.

And so, when stuff starts hitting the fan,

"What? Him? No! Surely!"

And then, everyone thought my mom
was the bitch, y'know, for not- y'know.

But then the news broke that

he did what he did to
one of the students on the team.

And- It's like when that comes out
you're not surprised, y'know? You just go-

When I saw my dad in the news,
I said "Oh, you idiot!"

Like I wasn't like "No!"
I was "Oh, dumbass! Goddamnit!"

But I wasn't surprised,

and it was just consequences
happening to somebody who was

really good at avoiding them for a long time, and...

I dunno, everybody- Everybody loves Jimmy.

And behind closed doors,
he is not super great,

and that image is

cultivated, purposefully and intentionally.

and it's branding, it's marketing, it's...

It's YouTube.

Okay, so I guess yeah. Just
one final question, on a serious note.

Obviously, the Ava Kris Tyson drama,

and,y'know, that's a known
issue of traditional media

Did you witness or hear about any
sexual misconduct at the company?

It's crazy, I probably hung out with Ava
the most out of the main cast

just because I was on Beast Hacks,

now Beast Reacts, I don't
know if it's still out.

That was a lot of fun 'cause it was just
being silly and goofy in front of a camera, and

Ava was the only person
who was willing to film.

Everybody else was too
busy or didn't want to,

and I was just trying to do my job. 

Sometimes, there'd be and offhanded joke.

That's a little gross. I mean, I'm a stand-up,
so I'm very desensitized to that.

I didn't hear anything that was like
"Whoa, that's crazy." When I saw-

The reason I messaged you, instead of
talking to a reporter sweetly like I have been,

was when I saw the Discord stuff

for the f- I never... 'Cause when
I got there, it was like 2019, so

I guess if the timelines
add up, that would've been like

handled, for lack of a better term,

and then they started bringing
more people on.

Maybe they thought they
had that under the rug, y'know.

"Alright, we handled that.
Now let's bring in some writers." Y'know?

When I saw it- all that stuff start coming out,

their potentiality, as of this
moment of recording,

I know this has been happening fast,
since everything's coming out so fast,

just the potential that Jimmy
could've been in those Discord chats

or even the potential that he
participated in those Discord chats...

After the shit he did to me...

And if you're gonna make fun of my dad...

I don't care what happens to me,
or my career, or my reputation after this.

I had to say some stuff. So,
whatever happens happens, at this point.

Outside of Ava Kris Tyson,

did you witness any, or hear about any,
sexual misconduct in the company?

I've heard rumors. I can't
confirm or deny anything.

I don't have any tangible
evidence, but I've heard stuff that I-

if it could be investigated, that'd be great.
But it's like water cooler talk.

But I've heard things, yes of course.

I heard people have been let go for
sexually assaulting some very young people.

The idea that Jimmy didn't know,

or that Jimmy was covering stuff up,
he didn't want stuff to come out,

he's very careful about his image.

Y'know, the tangible proof that he knew but
covered it up- yeah how do you prove that, y'know?

Well, there was a known

sex offender, registered sex offender,
convicted sex offender,

on the registry and everything,

who worked there.

And like, you can, y'know,

Someone pees in public, you're on
the registry, and you don't- you get a-

You can still have a job after you're
on the- That's not one- That's one thing.

You go to prison, you get rehabilitated,
that's one thing, y'know?

Like if you do your time, that's fine. I think
we should be read to rehabilitation in this country.

But that guy,

from what I hear, I can't
confirm or deny, from what I hear,

he's on the registry for doing some
not great stuff to some underaged people.

And they knew that.

He's working at a channel that has
underaged people on and around,

and is targeted to underaged people.

And they covered up the fact that
not only did he work there,

but he was like the manager
when it all started.

And you know that he knew it because,

he'll be in videos, he'll be in
thumbnails. He'll be around.

And whenever he is, he's wearing a mask.

Why would you wear a mask?
Why would you conceal your face?

It like- What are you concealing?

That you are a registered sex offender?
And that your face can be looked up on a thing?

How much more can you literally
cover up a sex offender?

With a physical ma- Like do I have to-

Is it more on the nose, or-?

I don't know why they let him go
'cause there's rumors back and forth.

So I don't know why they let him go,
but he did leave at one point.

Even if that guy didn't do anything,

they still knew about it,
and he was still around,

and what if he was one of
the people in the Discord servers?

What if he's not? I don't know.

But when I was there, they called him Delaware.

It's like "Well why do you call him Delaware?"
I didn't know, apparently they called him Delaware

'cause he's not allowed to
go back to Delaware.

That's his nickname?!

Colloquially? Like in a-

"Yeah, it's Delaware. Don't ask him why!"

The fuck?!

And Jimmy knew about him?

The likelihood that he didn't know
is astronomically low.

Alright, so finally I have a
recorded phone conversation.

The person on the other end of this line
is a different former Mr. Beast employee

talking about Delaware.

Also, apparently before this
phone conversation got recorded,

the person on the other
end of the line said that

the Mr. Beast team was actually trying to
expunge Delaware's record off the registry.

and that's what actually sparked
this person to start recording.

(speaking)

Okay, so Reed is Mr. Beast's
former manager who was in the last video

telling Jimmy, y'know "Hey,
don't promote gambling to children."

So I think Reed's taking
two W's this month, y'know.

"Don't promote gambling to children" and

"Don't have offenders on payroll."

Also yeah, just from where I'm sitting,

it seems extremely unlikely that
Jimmy wouldn't know, but I know that's-

I'm sure that's the defense he'll
go with, so I'll just say preemtively:

If, somehow, Jimmy didn't
know about Delaware,

I think it's still such an
extreme level of negligence

like what, you're not doing
background checks, you're not-

everyone at your company knows,
but somehow you don't know.

I think that needs more of
an explanation than just saying

"I didn't know."
Well how didn't you know?

How did this person get
into the company and then-

A company that makes content
for children, and is around children.

So yeah, Jimmy. I think we need
an explanation from you,

or y'know, your lawyers, and PR people,
and representatives, and spokespersons, and...

on how you could've not known
there was an offender

at a high level in your company.

And while you're responding to that,
why not respond to the allegations of

rigging contest videos, and
selling fake signatures.

running illegal lotteries,

the dangerous conditions on
the set of Beast Games,

you should address those too.

So yeah. Just let us know.

Okay, that was my interview with
former Mr. Beast employee Jake Weddle.

I know he will be coming out with
a longer cut of this interview,

as well as other content,
so I just wanted to shout him out.

Jake Weddle, top link in the description.

I've waited a long time to
talk about a lot of this publicly,

so thank you for doing what you're doing.
